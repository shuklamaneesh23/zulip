# Hide or reveal inactive channels

To avoid clutter in the [left sidebar](/help/left-sidebar), Zulip automatically
hides channels with no recent messages if you're subscribed to 20+ channels. You
can [configure](#configure-hiding-inactive-channels) Zulip to show or hide
inactive channels regardless of how many you're subscribed to.

It's easy to [reveal](#reveal-inactive-channels) or [find]() hidden inactive
channels if you need to access them.
